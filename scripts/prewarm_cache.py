"""Pre-warm the synthesis cache for key fishing spots.

Runs one synthesis question per spot and stores the result so future
queries about those locations are served cheaply from cache.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/prewarm_cache.py
    uv run python scripts/prewarm_cache.py --force   # clear cache first
