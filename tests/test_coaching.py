"""Coaching tests.

Rewritten to assert what reaches the model rather than what comes back from
it. The old versions called the live API and asserted `len(result) > 100`,
which fails without a network key and would have passed on a coach that
hallucinated every word of its answer. The prompt is the thing this service
actually builds, so the prompt is the thing under test.
