_MERGE_PROMPT = """\
You are maintaining a persistent fishing knowledge document for an angler.
Update the document below by merging in the new session summary.

RULES:
1. Keep all four sections: "Active plans", "Spots on the radar", "Learned patterns", "Species intel"
2. Active plans: add new trips being planned. When a trip has been LOGGED
   (appears in the user's trip history) or the date has clearly passed,
   move it from Active plans to a one-line "Completed trips" note, then
   remove it after 2 weeks. A plan that already happened should never stay
   in Active plans. If unsure whether a plan was completed, check if a
   matching session exists in Recent trips context.
3. Spots on the radar: add any new locations mentioned with coordinates if available.
   Include brief notes on what makes each spot notable. Keep indefinitely.
4. Learned patterns: add any confirmed fishing insights (what worked, what didn't,
   timing, conditions). These are permanent — never remove them.
5. Species intel: add species-specific tactics, bait, timing, or behaviour confirmed
   in conversation. Permanent.
6. If a section has nothing yet, write "(none yet)"
7. Be concise — each entry should be 1-2 lines max
8. LOCATION NAMES: You may include river or water body names when they are
   explicitly stated in the session summary. "Byng Island, Grand River" is
   correct if "Grand River" was mentioned. Do NOT invent or infer river names
   from your general knowledge — if the river wasn't stated in the summary,
   write just the location name without a river qualifier. A wrong river name
   is worse than no river name.
9. COORDINATES: If the session summary includes coordinates for a spot, include
   them in the spot entry in parentheses e.g. "Willoway Park, Grand River
   (42.917, -79.774)". Coordinates are unambiguous and more useful than names
   alone for large rivers with many distinct sections.
10. Do not add timestamps or dates unless they are part of an active plan
11. Output ONLY the updated document — no preamble, no explanation
