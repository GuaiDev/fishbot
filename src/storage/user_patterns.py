"""Persistence for the derived user layer.

The layer is recomputed when a session is logged, not when a question is
asked. Before this, every coaching question and every `get_my_fishing_summary`
re-read every stop the angler had ever logged and re-derived the same patterns
from scratch — work whose inputs change a few times a season, repeated several
times per conversation.

Two things make the cache safe to trust:

  * It stores a **fingerprint** of the inputs, not just a timestamp. A stale
    row is detected by the data having changed, not by having aged, so a
    direct DB edit or a restored backup cannot serve a wrong answer
    indefinitely.
  * A miss is not an error. `user_layer()` recomputes and stores. The cache is
    an optimisation, never a source of truth, and deleting the table changes
    performance rather than answers.
