"""Escalation for the records lookup — and only the records lookup.

The chain runs in Python, not as a sequence of model tool choices. That
collapses three round trips into one retrieval pass, which is both the
clarity win and the single biggest cost lever.

Nothing else escalates. You would never web-search for pH or a barrier count
— those exist in the corpus or they do not, and a search result claiming
otherwise is worse than an honest gap.
