"""Derived user layer.

Precomputed from logged activity. Never raw rows, and never a configured
profile: what someone cares about and how experienced they are is derived
from what they log, not from what they told a form once.

The core epistemic rule lives here in code rather than in prompt prose:

  * General ecological knowledge applied to observed conditions is legitimate
    immediately, at n=1. That is not this module's business — it needs no
    comparison set, so nothing here gates it.
  * Claims about the user's *own* patterns need a comparison set. A pattern
    is only `is_claimable` with both arms present. Same facts, different
    grammar: principles now, personal tendencies when earned.
