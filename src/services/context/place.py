"""Place resolution.

Anglers think in named stretches ("Byng Island"), the physical data is keyed
to OHN segment IDs, and sightings are points that do not snap cleanly to
either. So any input resolves to the same thing: a coordinate, a set of
segments, and a radius.

Resolution is local-only by design — OHN names, the user's own logged
location names, and ingested waterbodies. No geocoder: an unresolvable name
returns an honest failure rather than a confident guess at the wrong river.
