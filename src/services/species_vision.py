"""Claude vision species suggestion for a logged catch photo.

Mirrors vision_screening.py's image-analysis pattern. This is a suggestion
for the angler to confirm or correct, never a final answer — the candidate
list sent to the model is always the real regional species pool (see
query_deduped_species_ranges_for_jurisdiction), so the model structurally
cannot invent a species outside what actually lives here. Anything it
returns outside that list, or that it isn't at least low-confidence about,
comes back unresolved rather than guessed.
