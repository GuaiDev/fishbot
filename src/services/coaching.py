"""On-demand coaching, built on the central context layer.

Previously this service assembled its own prompt block from raw `stops` rows:
its own formatting, its own idea of what an empty log meant, its own decision
about which columns mattered. Two consequences followed from that, and both
were bugs rather than style:

  * Stored insights reached the model as anonymous sentences. An insight the
    assistant synthesised and one drawn from a survey rendered identically.
  * Nothing consulted the conservation layer. A coaching question about a
    listed species produced targeting advice, because the SAR check lived in a
    different code path that this one never called.

Both are properties of bypassing the context layer, so the fix is to stop
bypassing it. Retrieval and rendering happen there; what remains here is the
coaching question itself and the rules the answer has to obey.

- Every fact below carries its source in square brackets. A claim marked
  "reasoning, no source" or "web, unverified" is NOT a record — do not present
  it as one, and say which kind of thing you are relying on.
- General fishing and ecology principles applied to the conditions shown are
  fine to state directly, even from a single trip.
- Claims about THIS angler's own patterns ("you do better in X") require a
  pattern marked claimable below. If it says NOT yet claimable, you may raise
  it as a hypothesis to test, never as a finding.
- Do not invent sessions, patterns or conditions that are not shown.
- Where the data is empty, the reason is given. Say which gap it is; "no data"
  on its own is not an acceptable answer.
- Blanks are not failures. They are half the signal and worth analysing.
- Match the register to the demonstrated expertise shown. Telling an
  experienced angler something obvious destroys credibility."""

can be answered without targeting guidance, say plainly why you are declining
the rest, and suggest the angler verify the current listing themselves."""
