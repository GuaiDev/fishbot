"""Untapped potential scoring — combines pressure, access, and structure.

Formula per segment:
  untapped_score = (1 - observation_pressure) × access_modifier
                   × structural_bonus × remoteness_multiplier
                   × plausibility_gate

Where:
  observation_pressure = normalised observation_density_25km (0–1)
  access_modifier      = access_score (easy_access), (1-access+0.1) (adventure),
                         or 1.0 (balanced)
  structural_bonus     = confluence and waterbody proximity multiplier (1.0–2.0)
  remoteness_multiplier = 1.5 if obs_density==0, 1.25 if 1–4, 1.0 if 5+
  plausibility_gate    = 1.0 normally, 0.0 for segments with affirmative
                         evidence they are not fishable water (see below)

No habitat term. The SDM that formerly supplied one scored 0.51–0.61 AUC on
spatial cross-validation — barely better than random — and its unreliability
had been patched over with a 0.35 floor. A weak signal presented as a ranking
term is worse than no term, because it launders noise as confidence.

What replaces it is a gate, not a score. The gate only ever rules segments
OUT, and only on affirmative evidence (a mapped ditch, a measured hypoxic
reading). Missing data never excludes: 99.3% of segments have no thermal
class and 99.3% have no dissolved-oxygen reading, so treating absence as
disqualifying would erase the corpus. This mirrors the project rule that
water-quality data rules out implausible predictions but never confirms
presence.

Consequence, stated plainly: ranking is now driven by observation scarcity,
structure, and access. The gate trims known-bad water; it does not and cannot
rank water by quality. Judging whether a stretch is worth the drive is the
job of describe(), which surfaces the underlying records.
