"""BC Freshwater Fishing Regulations — PDF ingestion.

Downloads the BC Freshwater Fishing Regulations Synopsis PDF and splits it
into one text chunk per management region (Regions 1-6, 8, plus the split
Region 7A/7B).

Source:
  BC Ministry of Environment — 2025-2027 synopsis

  (the old outdoor-recreation/freshwater-fishing-regulations/... URL 404s;
  find the current link at the BC fishing regulations landing page if this
  one goes stale too — filenames on this site are not dated/versioned so
  there's no reliable pattern to predict the next change).

BC's region scheme changed in the 2025-2027 synopsis: the historic Region 7
(Omineca-Peace) split into 7A (Omineca) and 7B (Peace), and a new Region 8
(Okanagan) was carved out (previously folded into Region 3/Thompson-Nicola).
zone is stored as an int PK, so 7A/7B map to synthetic ids 71/72 — zone_name
carries the real label ("Omineca", "Peace").

pdfplumber's extract_text() renders the Region 7A (Omineca) chapter's running
header with every character doubled (e.g. "RREEGGIIOONN 77AA -- OOmmiinneeccaa"),
apparently from an overlapping duplicate text layer in the source PDF present
only on those pages — every other region's header extracts cleanly. The
region-header pattern below tolerates single-character doubling (each
expected character optionally followed by itself) to catch this; matched
snippets are only de-doubled (collapse consecutive identical characters) as
a fallback when they fail to parse as-is, so legitimate double letters in
region names (Kootenay, Cariboo) are never touched.

Each region's header repeats as a running header on every page of its
chapter (verified: 5-8 repeats per region in the 2025-2027 synopsis) — chunks
are built by grouping consecutivally-matched same-region headers into one
run and taking the full span from the run's first match to the start of the
next differently-labelled match, not by naively slicing between every pair
of matches (the region name also appears scattered in the table of contents
and cross-references; picking the run with the largest resulting span per
region reliably selects the real chapter over those incidental mentions).

Table: regulation_chunks
  PK: (zone, jurisdiction, regulation_year)
  zone is the Region number (1-6, 8) or synthetic 71/72 for 7A/7B;
  zone_name is the Region name.

Cache TTL: 365 days (biennial-ish BC synopsis; the actual cadence has
drifted before, so this is a ceiling not a promise — check data.bc.gov.ca
if a re-ingest returns suspiciously old-looking content).
